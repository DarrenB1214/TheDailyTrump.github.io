          <h4>Our Goal</h4>
          <p>
          	The Goal we have for this app is to distribute it through communities, to help people see some, pardon for my slang, Dank Trump Tweets.
          </p>

          <h4>Our Inspiration</h4>
          <p>
          	We just sat in a class one day, and we were like..."Why not build an App to help people find great Trump Tweets???" That is how it started and yes, those three question marks are necessary for your information.
          </p>

          <h4>The App's Purpose on Your Device</h4>
          <p>
          	Nothing much but to look at some tweets many people have seen if they have a Twitter, and let's be honest...who really has a Twitter nowadays not to be mean or anything...don't sue us Twitter...we still have a space for you in our hearts.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>App's Quality</h4>
          <p>
          	The app has a great layout and is easy to read, unlike most colored background things(like posters for an elementary school project) and will receive an occasional update when a tweet is changed or the interface changes.
          </p>

          <h4>Sponsors</h4>
          <p>
          	No One...Did you really think that even our Parent's would have donated some money to this app?
          </p>

          <h4>The Really-Hard to Read and The No One Even Bothers to Read Them Anyway Disclaimers</h4>
          <p id="Disclaimers">
          	This app is not intended to be sold in any shape or form. The resale or selling of this app is illegal and can be charged up to 5 BTC. Once you download this app, you happily give away your right to file complaints about this app or to sue us for no reason at all with out complaining to the makers first. The consumer of the app also gives away their right to report the app since it must have been downloaded from an open source downloading site, because One: The app is free, and Two: Since the app isn't guidlined by any major app distributor like Google Play or The App Store. If a complaint is issued, the makers of the app have the right to refuse to acknowledge it and the right to say that you can not complain about the app since it says so it the Disclaimer that you should have read but didn't anyway since it was too long or you were just lazy like most people. It is the right of the makers of the app to create any form of press and it can't be limited by anyone unless there is any form of Law limiting certain stuff, like there shouldn't be a promotion of drugs or age restricted content on an app that is intended for many audiences. It is the right of the makers to create any form of press outside of a school since the app was not created for a school thing, and was created outside the campus therefore not restricted by those regulations. There is not a requirement for downloading this app, you don't have to keep this on your device if you don't want to and is downloaded with your own consent knowing that we the makers aren't responsible if you get a virus or bug from this app if it is downloaded from an untrusted/unverified source. You also give the makers the right to access certain applications/files/folders of your phone in order to download this app, if the makers feel that they want to add more features like videos,etc. If you are still reading this, we give you props. Not many people people read this and it takes a good 10 minutes of typing up something great to avoid lawsuits, and for those who just skipped to the end(You know who you are and so do we...We don't really like you...just kidding!) please don't do it again. Now you can stop reading this...or you can ignore the past comment like a rebel and continue reading...this can go on and on...just stop it already...no is benefitting from this(mainly you)...This is the finale of the Disclaimers(Real this time, there is nothing after the end of this sentence as you can see or not if you are slightly blind or wear glasses.).
